>> HEY! WE WILL TALK ABOUT THESE IN A
33:40
MINUTE. WELCOME TO CONNECT!
33:52
ALL RIGHT! A EYEGLASSES AND VIRTUAL REALITY. OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD GREAT LOOKING GLASSES THAT DELIVER
33:58
PERSONAL SUPERINTELLIGENCE, AND A FEELING OF PRESENCE USING
34:04
REALISTIC HOLOGRAMS, AND THESE IDEAS COMBINED.
34:11
NOW GLASSES ARE THE IDEAL FORM FACTOR FOR PERSONAL SUPERINTELLIGENCE, THEY LET YOU THEY PRESENT IN THE MOMENT WHILE
34:21
GETTING ACCESS TO ALL THESE AI CAPABILITIES THAT MAKE YOU SMARTER, HELP YOU COMMUNICATE
34:28
BETTER, IMPROVE YOUR MEMORY, IMPROVE YOUR CENSUS AND MORE.
34:33
GLASSES ARE THE ONLY FORM FACTOR WHERE YOU CAN LET AIC WHAT YOU SEE, HERE WHAT YOU HEAR, TALK TO
34:39
YOU THROUGHOUT THE DAY, AND VERY SOON, GENERATED WHATEVER AI YOU
34:45
NEED IN REALTIME. IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT A EYEGLASSES ARE TAKING OFF. THIS IS NOW OUR THIRD YEAR
34:52
SHIPPING AI PARTNER -- GLASSES WITH OUR GREAT PARTNER,
35:03
ESSILORLUXOTTICA, AND THE SALES PROJECTOR WE HAVE SEEN SIMILAR
35:09
TO SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR CONSUMER ELECTRONICS OF ALL TIME. WE ARE FOCUSED ON DESIGNING
35:14
GLASSES WITH A FEW CLEAR VALUES. NUMBER 1, THEY NEED TO BE GREAT GLASSES FIRST.
35:21
NOW BEFORE WE GET TO ANY OF THE TECHNOLOGY, THE GLASSES NEED TO BE WELL-DESIGNED AND COMFO
35:28
COMFORTABLE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR GLASSES ON YOUR FACE ALL DAY, EVERY DAY,
35:33
THEY NEED TO BE REFINED INTO THEIR ESTHETICS, AND THEY HAVE TO BE RIGHT. IN ADDITION TO WORKING WITH
35:41
ICONIC BRANDS, WE HAVE SPENT YEARS OF ENGINEERING, OBSESSING
35:48
OVER HOW TO SHAPE EVERY FRACTION OF A MILLIMETER AND A PORTION OF A GRANDMA WE CAN FROM EVERY PAIR OF GLASSES THAT WE SHIP, AND I
35:54
THINK THAT SHOWS IN THE WORK. NUMBER 2. THE TECHNOLOGY AGAINST -- NEEDS
36:00
TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. THE PROMISE OF GLASSES IS TO PRESERVE THE SENSE OF PRESENCE
36:06
THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU ARE WITH OTHER PEOPLE.
36:11
THIS FEELING OF PRESENCE IS A PROFOUND THING, I THINK WE HAVE LOST IT A LITTLE BIT WITH PH
36:18
PHONES, AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET IT BACK WITH GLASSES. WHEN WE ARE DESIGNING THE
36:24
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, WE FOCUS ON GIVING ACCESS TO VERY POWERFUL TOOLS WHEN YOU WANT THEM, AND THEN HAVING THEM FADE
36:30
INTO THE BACKGROUND OTHERWISE. NUMBER 3.
36:35
TAKE SUPERINTELLIGENCE SERIOUSLY. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MOST
36:43
IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY OF OUR LIFETIMES. AI SHOULD SERVE PEOPLE, NOT JUST
36:48
BE SOMETHING THAT SITS IN A DATA CENTER AUTOMATING LARGE PARTS OF SOCIETY. WE DESIGN OUR GLASSES TO BE ABLE
36:56
TO EMPOWER PEOPLE WITH NEW CAPABILITIES, AS SOON AS THEY BECOME POSSIBLE. THINK IN ADVANCE ABOUT WHAT KIND
37:04
OF SENSORS WILL BE NECESSARY, WE MAKER TO SEEK AN UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE AND MAKE YOUR GLASSES
37:10
AND YOURSELF SMARTER, DIRECT AI TOWARDS WHAT MATTERS MOST IN YOUR LIFE. ALL RIGHT.
37:15
WITH ALL THAT SAID, WE DO HAVE SOME NEW GLASSES TO SHOW YOU TODAY. [CHEERING]
37:21
AND I WANT TO START WITH THESE,
37:27
THE NEXT GENERATION OF RAY-BAN META GLASSES. [CHEERING]
37:34
NOW THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL,
37:39
ICONIC DESIGN -- I THINK THESE ARE THE MOST POPULAR GLASSES DESIGN IN HISTORY.
37:44
AND NOW WITH DOUBLE THE BATTERY LIFE --
37:50
[CHEERING] I WEAR THEM ALL DAY, THEY NEVER RUN OUT OF BATTERY. IT HAS 3K VIDEO RECORDING,
37:59
DOUBLE OUR PREVIOUS RESOLUTION FOR A SMARTER THERE -- SMARTER
38:04
AND SMOOTHER VIDEO, THESE ARE ALL SHOT WITH RAY-BAN META.
38:10
META AI KEEPS ON GETTING BETTER. LAST YEAR I DID THIS LIVE DATA -- DEMO TRANSLATING BETWEEN TWO
38:18
PEOPLE ON STAGE, TODAY I AM EXCITED TO INTRODUCE A FEATURE
38:23
WE CALL CONVERSATION FOCUS. IT IS A NEW FEATURE COMING SOON THAT WILL BE ABLE TO AMPLIFY YOUR FRIENDS VOICES IN YOUR EAR.
38:32
SO IF YOU ARE IN A NOISY RESTAURANT, YOU ARE BASICALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO TURN UP THE
38:38
VOLUME ON YOUR FRIENDS OR WHOEVER YOU ARE TALKING TO. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE]
38:46
AND CONVERSATION FOCUS, IT IS NOT ONLY GOING TO BE ON THE NEW
38:54
RAY-BAN META, IT WILL BE AVAILABLE AS A SOFTWARE UPDATE ON ALL THE EXISTING RAY-BAN
39:00
META'S TOO. TO SHOW THOSE, WE HAVE DONNIE
39:06
AND JACK IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK TO SHOW HOW THIS WORKS.
39:11
>> HELLO JOHNNY. >> HELLO, HOW ARE YOU? RENAISSANCE VIBES GOING ON. JACK.

39:44
HOW DO I BE MORE NATURAL? >> SOMETIMES I PLAY AROUND, FIXTURES LEAVE A LITTLE BIT.
39:49
LIKE NOBODY IS AROUND.
39:55
[CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] >> ALL RIGHT! CONVERSATION FOCUS.
40:03
WE ARE ALSO IMPROVING LIVE AI. AS WE OPTIMIZE BATTERY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY, META AI WILL
40:10
TRANSITION FROM BEING SOMETHING THAT YOU INVOKE WHEN YOU HAVE A QUESTION, TO A SERVICE RUNNING
40:15
ALL THE TIME HELPING YOU OUT THROUGHOUT THE DAY. TO BE CLEAR, WE ARE NOT THERE YET ON ALL DAY LIVE AI.
40:23
IT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES WE ARE WORKING THROUGH. BUT TODAY YOU CAN USE LIVE AI
40:29
FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR. TO GET A FEELING FOR WHAT THIS IS LIKE, LET'S CUT TO CHEF JACK

42:12
WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING GLASSES, THERE IS AN IMPORTANT INTERSECTION BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY,
42:20
FASHION AND STYLE. THAT TECHNOLOGY KEEPS GETTING MORE USEFUL, AND AS I SAID

50:17
OF OUR LIVES IN, AND SOMETHING I THINK IS DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING I HAVE SEEN ANYWHERE ELSE.
50:26
I AM REALLY PROUD OF THIS, AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF OUR TEAM FOR ACHIEVING THIS.
50:33
THIS IS META RAY-BAN DISPLAY.
50:43
THESE ARE GLASSES WITH THE CLASSIC STYLE YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM RAY-BAN, BUT THEY ARE THE
50:48
FIRST AI GLASSES WITH A HIGH-RESOLUTION DISPLAY. AND, A WHOLE NEW WAY TO INTERACT
50:56
WITH THEM. THE META NEURAL BAND, THIS GUY.

ALL RIGHT. THIS IS NOT A PROTOTYPE, THIS IS
51:12
HERE, IT IS READY TO GO, AND YOU CAN BUY THEM IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. [CHEERING]
51:18
ALL RIGHT. SO, WHAT IS NEW HERE?
51:23
THEY ARE TWO KEY INNOVATIONS, THE DISPLAY AND THE NEURAL
51:29
INTERFACE. THE DISPLAY IS LARGE ENOUGH TO WATCH A VIDEO OR READ THE THREAT
51:36
OF MESSAGES, IT APPEARS IN ONE EYE, IT IS SLIGHTLY OFF-CENTER
51:42
SO IT DOES NOT BLOCK YOUR VIEW, AND IT DISAPPEARS AFTER A FEW SECONDS WHEN IT IS NOT IN USE SO
51:49
DOES NOT DISTRACT YOU. IT IS VERY HIGH-RESOLUTION AND VERY BRIGHT.
51:54
I MEAN LIKE 42 PIXELS PER DEGREE, SHARPER THAN ANY MAJOR HEADSET OUT THERE, AND UP TO 5000 NEXT OF A BRIGHTNESS IT IS
52:02
CRISP WEATHER YOU ARE INDOORS OR OUTDOORS ON THE SUNNIEST DAY. THIS REQUIRED A CUSTOM LIGHT
52:10
ENGINE, WAVEGUIDE TO DELIVER THIS, A LOT OF AWESOME
52:15
TECHNOLOGY. THEN THERE IS THE NEURAL INTERFACE.
52:21
EVERY NEW COMPUTING PLATFORM HAS ANY WEIGHT TO INTERFACE.
52:28
SO FOR THE GLASSES, WE ARE REPLACING THE KEYBOARD, MOUSE, TOUCHSCREEN, BUTTONS, DIALS,
52:35
WITH THE ABILITY TO SEND SIGNALS FROM YOUR BRAIN WITH LITTLE MUSCLE MOVEMENTS THAT THE NEURAL
52:43
BAND WILL PICK UP, YOU CAN SILENTLY CONTROL YOUR GLASSES
52:49
WITH BARELY PERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENTS. THE META NEURAL BAND IS A HUGE
52:55
SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH. WE HAVE BUILT A NEURAL INTERFACE INTO A DURABLE, LIGHTWEIGHT,
53:02
COMFORTABLE AND GOOD-LOOKING WRISTBAND WITH 18 HOURS OF
53:07
BATTERY LIFE AND IS WATER RESISTANT.
53:12

53:18
NOW, I WANT TO GET INTO THIS IN MORE DETAIL, WE HAVE TWO
53:23
OPTIONS, THE SLIDES OR THE LIVE DEMO. [CHEERING]
53:31
LET'S DO IT LIVE! ALL RIGHT! NOW, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
53:39
AND FREQUENT THINGS THAT WE ALL DO ON OUR PHONES IS SEND MESSAGES. WHEN WE WERE DESIGNING THESE
53:46

53:51
AND LOOK, HE IS MESSAGING ME RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT.
53:59
NOW OKAY, I CAN GO AHEAD AND DICTATED WITH MY VOICE, I CAN

SEND A VOICE CLIP, BUT I HAVE THIS NEURAL BAND, AND IT IS
54:09

A GLIMPSE OF HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK WITH AI. THE BASIC IDEA HERE IS, WE ALL

1:00:57
FIVE THINGS YOU WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON, MAY BE SOMETHING YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO, A CONVERSATION

OF RAY-BAN META, INCLUDING OUR SPECIAL ADDITION, THE OAKLEY META-THAT WE RELEASED IN THE SUMMER, OAKLEY META VANGUARD AND
1:04:47
NOW THE META RAY-BAN DISPLAY. THOSE ARE OUR FALL 2025 GLASSES.
1:04:53
[CHEERING]
1:05:00
ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON!
1:05:07
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN AI AND VIRTUAL REALITY.
1:05:16
WE WANT TO BRING ABOUT A FUTURE WHERE ANYBODY CAN DREAM UP ANY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN THINK OF
1:05:22
AND THEN JUST CREATE. WITH AI WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THIS A LITTLE BIT WITH WRITING, PHOTOS, EVEN THE EARLY PART OF
1:05:34
BOTCHED PRETTY SOON I THINK PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE ENTIRELY NEW IMMERSIVE AND
1:05:41
INTERACTIVE TYPES OF CONTENT, WHOLE WORLD, GAMES, CARICATURES,
1:05:47
ARTS, HOLOGRAMS THAT COMPLEMENT THE PHYSICAL OBJECT AROUND YOU. THIS IS A BIG DEAL, BECAUSE
1:05:52
RIGHT NOW CREATING THIS TYPE OF 3D, IMMERSIVE, INTERACTIVE
1:05:58
CONTENT IS HARD. IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GRADE GREAT VIRTUAL OR AUGMENTED REALITY CONTENT, THAT IS WHAT IS
1:06:07
HOLDING BACK THE ECOSYSTEM. BUT WE ARE NOT FAR FROM BEING ABLE TO CREATE THIS TYPE OF
1:06:12
CONTENT JUST AS EASILY AS HE WOULD PROMPT META AI TODAY. I THINK THIS WILL TRANSFORM NOT
1:06:17
JUST VIRTUAL REALITY, BUT ALSO
1:06:24
THE KIND OF CONTENT YOU CAN GET ON GLASSES, AND CONTENT YOU SEE
1:06:29
ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND EXPERIENCES LIKE FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. TODAY WE ARE TAKING A FEW BIG
1:06:35
STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION. FIRST, META HORIZON.
1:06:45
OVER THE LAST YEAR, WE HAVE RELEASED A NUMBER OF AI TOOLS TO GENERATE TYPESCRIPT, AUDIO,
1:06:52
SKYBOXES AND MORE, SO CREATORS CREATE HIGHER-QUALITY WORLDS IN
1:06:58
A FRACTION OF THE TIME. SOON, META HORIZON STUDIO WILL
1:07:05
CREATE AN AI ASSISTANT THAT WILL STITCH TOGETHER ALL THESE DIFFERENT TOOLS, AND FURTHER SPEED UP THE CREATION PROCESS USING JUST SIMPLE TEXT BOX.
1:07:15
POWERING THIS IS OUR BRAND-NEW
1:07:20
META HORIZON ENGINE. [CHEERING]
1:07:27
NOW THIS IS A NEW ENGINE THAT WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUILDING FROM SCRATCH TO REPLACE THE UNITY, WHICH WAS
1:07:37
GREAT BUT WAS NOT BUILT FOR THIS CASE. THIS ENGINE IS FULLY OPTIMIZED FOR BRINGING THE METAVERSE TO LIFE, IT IS MUCH FASTER,
1:07:48
PERFORMANCE AND LOADING THINGS, BETTER GRAPHICS, EASIER TO CREATE WITH. NOW YOU CAN CREATE INFINITE,
1:07:56
CONNECTED SPACES THAT LOOK WAY, WAY BETTER WITH REALISTIC PHYSICS AND INTERACTIONS.
1:08:02
NOW TO CHECK THIS OUT, WHAT THIS ENGINE CAN DO, LET'S WALK THROUGH THE NEW EXPERIENCES WE ARE ROLLING OUT.
1:08:09
FIRST, THE GRAPHIC FIDELITY MEANS THE HYPERSPACE CASES -- HYPERLAPSE SPACES ARE REALLY QUITE SOMETHING.
1:08:16
I HAVE SHOWN A PROTOTYPE OF THIS LAST YEAR, TODAY WE ARE ROLLING
1:08:21
OUT EARLY ACCESS TO HYPERIS CAPTURE -- HYPERSCAPE -- YOU CAN
1:08:33
SCANNED THE ROOM AND JUST IN A FEW MINUTES TURN IT INTO AN
1:08:39
IMMERSIVE, TRUE TO LIFE WORLD. PRETTY AWESOME. [APPLAUSE]
1:08:44
NOW EVENTUALLY YOU CAN SEAMLESSLY BLEND HYPERSCAPE INTO
1:08:55
HORIZON AND HAVE THEM BE CONNECTED, TOO. THIS IS OUR NEW IMMERSIVE HOME,
1:09:02
RENDERED ENTIRELY AND META HORIZON ENGINE. VISUALLY, A BIG STEP FORWARD FROM WHERE WE HAVE BEEN.
1:09:07
THERE IS NO EIFFEL TOWER HERE. [LAUGHTER] YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR HOME, YOU
1:09:13
CAN PIN DIFFERENT APPS TO THE WALL, LIKE THIS INSTAGRAM APP
1:09:20
AUTOMATICALLY RENDERS YOUR POSTS FROM CREATORS AND FRIENDS IN A 3D, WHICH IS PRETTY AWESOME.
1:09:26
YOU CAN ALSO JUMP STRAIGHT FROM YOUR HOME TO A SERIES OF INTERCONNECTED WORLDS. WITH A NEW ENGINE MAKES IT FOUR
1:09:32
TIMES FASTER TO LOAD AND RENDER NEW WORLDS, SO NOW IT IS A FEW SECONDS.
1:09:39
IT'S MORE LIKE LOADING A WEB PAGE THAN LOADING AN ENTIRE NEW GAME, WHICH MAKES IT A WHOLE LOT EASIER TO CREATE THIS
1:09:45
INTERCONNECTED METAVERSE.
1:09:50
HORIZON ENGINE ALSO ENABLES MUCH GREATER CONCURRENCY AND MANY MORE PEOPLE TO BE IN THE SAME WORLD AT THE SAME TIME.
1:09:55
WE NOW SUPPORT FIVE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE IN THE SAME WORLD
1:10:01
COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS ENGINE. [CHEERING] THAT IS GOING TO ENABLE A LOT OF
1:10:09
NEAT THINGS. THAT SAY YOU WANT TO HEAD OVER TO THE NEW ARENA TO SEE A CONCERT, OR YOU WANT TO WATCH
1:10:17
THIS CONNECT KEYNOTE LIVE, YOU WILL GO THERE AND SEE A LOT OF
1:10:22
PEOPLE. THEY ARE ALIVE AND YOU CAN INTERACT WITH THEM. ANYWAY. THIS IS META HORIZON STUDIO AND
1:10:32
META HORIZON ENGINE, FOUNDATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE METAVERSE, THEY WILL ENABLE INTERACTIVE AND IMMERSIVE WORLDS
1:10:39
ACROSS ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS, STARTING WITH VIRTUAL REALITY, AND THEN ONE DAY, COMING TO YOUR
1:10:45
GLASSES AND COMING TO SOCIAL MEDIA AS WELL. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE]
1:10:51
ALL RIGHT! LAST THING I WANT TO COVER.
1:10:58
QUEST CONTINUES TO HAVE THE VERY BEST SLATE OF VIRTUAL REALITY
1:11:03
GAMES, WE HAVE MARVEL DEADPOOL VR, "DUNGEONS & DRAGONS", BATTLE
1:11:12
MARK ALL LAUNCHING THIS FALL.
1:11:19
IT ALSO HAS -- IT'S VERY NEED TO SEE HOW WE PEOPLE ARE USING QUEST TO WATCH VIDEO CONTENT, A LOT MORE IMMERSIVE.
1:11:28
WE THINK THAT THIS CATEGORY, WATCHING VIDEO CONTENT, WILL BE
1:11:35
A HUGE CATEGORY. BOWS IN VIRTUAL REALITY HAD SAID AND ON GLASSES. WE ARE LAUNCHING A NEW ENTERTAINMENT HUB THAT WE ARE
1:11:41
CALLING HORIZON TV.
1:11:47
AND WE ARE WORKING WITH A BUNCH OF GREAT PARTNERS TO INCLUDE A
1:11:53
BUNCH OF MOVIES AND TV AND LIVE SPORTS AND MUSIC. I AM EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT
1:12:00
DISNEY+ IS COMING TO HORIZON TV, AND BRINGING CONTENT FROM HULU AND ESPN.
1:12:06
[APPLAUSE] WE ARE ALSO PARTNERING WITH
1:12:13
UNIVERSAL STUDIOS, UNIVERSAL PICTURES, AND ICONIC HORROR COMPANY, AS YOU CAN WATCH HORROR MOVIES LIKE LACK PHONE OR M3GAN
1:12:18
WITH 3D SPECIAL EFFECTS WILL NOW TAKE OVER YOUR SPACE.
1:12:27
HORIZON TV ALSO SUPPORTS DOLBY
1:12:33
ATMOS AND DOBIE VISION, RICH COLORS, CRISP DETAILS FOR A MORE OVERT -- IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE --
1:12:40
DOLBY VISION. ALL RIGHT. I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT
1:12:48
THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES WILL UNLOCK FOR ARTISTS AND ENTERTAINMENT. I THINK THE SHIFT TOWARDS MORE
1:12:54
IMMERSIVE STORYTELLING, 3D STORYTELLING, WILL BE ONE OF THE MORE EXCITING DEVELOPMENTS IN
1:12:59
THE COMING YEARS. I THINK IT WILL DRIVE A NEW WAVE OF ADOPTION OF VIRTUAL REALITY
1:13:05
AND GLASSES. SO, I WANTED TO CLOSE TODAY BY
1:13:11
HEARING FROM THE PIONEER OF
1:13:17
IMMERSIVE, CUTTING EDGE STORYTELLING WITH CGI, 3D FILMMAKING AND MORE, PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOME TO THE STAGE,
1:13:23
LEGENDARY FILMMAKER JAMES CAMERON, ALONG WITH BUZZ.
1:13:33
THANK YOU!
1:13:41
>> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MARK. JAMES CAMERON REALLY NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION. I'M GOING TO TRY OUT OF RESPECT.
1:13:49
THE MOST FAMOUS FILMMAKER, UNPRECEDENTED HIT RATE IN HOLLYWOOD, BUT ALSO, AND
1:13:55
CRITICALLY FOR OUR PARTNERSHIP, A REAL PIONEER IN TECHNOLOGY. CONSISTENTLY PUSHING THE TECHNOLOGY HE NEEDS TO FULFILL
1:14:01
HIS CREATIVE VISION. AS MARK SAID, WHETHER THAT BE IN 3D STORYTELLING OR EVEN BUILDING
1:14:06
A SUBMARINE. HE'S ON THE WHOLE RANGE. THANK YOU FOR COMING TO CONNECT.
1:14:11
WE ARE SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU. >> IT'S A HUGE HONOR. SUCH A BIG DAY FOR YOU GUYS. I'M GLAD YOU WERE ABLE TO
1:14:18
SQUEEZE ME IN. APPRECIATE IT. >> ANY TIME, REALLY. YOU AND I HAVE TALKED A LOT
1:14:23
ABOUT YOUR PASSION FOR 3D FILMMAKING AND IT GOES BACK A LONG WAYS, TWO DECADES. TALK TO ME ABOUT WHERE THAT COME
1:14:29
FROM AND WHY HE BELIEVES STRONGLY IN THIS. >> I HAVE SPENT MY FILMMAKING
1:14:34
CAREER TRYING TO REALLY ENGAGE PEOPLE, DRAW THEM IN, GET THEM INVOLVED IN THE STORY ON THE CHARACTERS. I WAS FIRST EXPOSED TO 3D
1:14:40
FILMMAKING IN THE 19 -- 1998, I THINK. AND IT WAS MASSIVE SOME CAMERAS,
1:14:47
FOR UNIVERSAL FOR A RIDE SHOW. I THOUGHT, WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS BETTER.
1:14:53
AND WHEN DIGITAL CAMERAS CAME ALONG I WAS A SUPER EARLY ADOPTER. GEORGE LUCAS AND THEN ME, AND THAT WAS IN '99, 2000.
1:15:01
AND I SAID, WHY CAN'T WE SLAP TWO OF THESE THINGS SIDE-BY-SIDE AND MAKE 3D? IT TURNED OUT TO BE A LOT MORE
1:15:08
COLLOCATED THAN THAT. 25 YEARS LATER I AM PLEASED TO SAY I'VE GOT A GREAT 3D TEAM AND
1:15:13
WE HAVE MADE -- NOT ONLY MY FILMS, WE HAVE MADE 3D CAMERAS AVAILABLE TO A LOT OF OTHER
1:15:21
FILMMAKERS, DOING CONCERT FILMS AND SPORTS FOR TV, WHICH DIDN'T LAST LONG, AND LOTS OF BIG
1:15:27
MOVIES. RIDLEY SCOTT, THAT SORT OF THING. I LOVE 3D PERSONALLY, I LOVE
1:15:34
AUTHORING IN IT AND I LOVE SEEING THE END RESULT WHEN IT'S DONE PROPERLY, AND IT'S HOW WE
1:15:39
PERCEIVE THE WORLD. WHY DO WE THROW AWAY 50% OF OUR DATA AND SEE EVERYTHING THROUGH
1:15:45
A SINGLE EYE? IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME.
1:15:54
AND SOME OF THE NEW STUFF COMING
1:15:59
DOWN THE LINE. I THINK WE ARE LOOKING AT A FUTURE THAT IS ALL NEW DISTRIBUTION MODEL WHERE WE HAVE
1:16:05
THEATER GRADE 3D. A SICKLY ON YOUR HEAD.
1:16:12
>> YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW -- WHEN WE FIRST MET YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW VISUAL FIDELITY MATTERS TO YOU IN THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE
1:16:19
SCREEN AND THE FULLNESS OF THE EFFECT YOU'RE GETTING FROM IT. FOR A LONG TIME THE HEADSETS WEREN'T THERE.
1:16:24
THEY WEREN'T EVEN AS GOOD AS TV LET ALONE THE THEATER. NOW WE ARE SEEING SOMETHING
1:16:30
DIFFERENT. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PUT THE HEADSET ON. YOU'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD NOW
1:16:36
ON "AVATAR: FIRE -- "COMING IN DECEMBER. YOU'VE GOTTEN A CHANCE TO SEE
1:16:41
SOME OF THESE PIECES IN HEADSET AND YOU HAD A PRETTY SURPRISING REACTION. HE SAID THAT'S HOW YOU THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE SEEN.
1:16:49
>> I'VE BEEN FIGHTING SO HARD WITH MOVIE THEATERS TO GET THE BRIGHTNESS LEVELS UP, TO INSTALL LASER PROJECTION, BUT THEY ARE
1:16:54
CAUGHT IN AN EARLIER PARADIGM. NO BUSINESS CAN SURVIVE BEING
1:17:00
STUCK IN TECHNOLOGY 15 YEARS O OLD. SO WHEN I PUT ON THE QUEST 3 AND
1:17:06
I SAW SOME OF MY OWN CONTENT, WHICH I KNEW, BECAUSE I HAD THIS BASELINE CALIBRATION AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE,
1:17:13
TO SEE IT AT LIGHT LEVELS BEYOND
1:17:20
THE STANDARD FOR THEATER PRODUCTION, THE BEST YOU WILL SEE IS 16-FOOT LAMBERTS, MOST
1:17:26
ARE AT 3-FOOT LAMBERTS, WHICH IS THE THEATER VERSION. >> A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE
1:17:32
GOOGLING FOOT LAMBERTS RIGHT N NOW.
1:17:38
>> AND THE QUEST IS THAT THE 30-FOOT LAMBERT EQUIVALENT, SO THAT IS ON AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE
1:17:45
BRIGHTER. THE BRIGHTNESS GIVES YOU THE DYNAMIC RANGE, THE COLOR SPACE, AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE.
1:17:50
AND THAT IS SO MUCH MORE ENGAGING. THE WORK THAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE IN THE QUEST SERIES TO EXPAND
1:17:56
THE FIELD OF VIEW, TO GET THE BRIGHTNESS, TO GET THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION, TO ME IT'S LIKE
1:18:02
BEING IN MY OWN PRIVATE MOVIE THEATER. >> I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S HAPPENING NOW.
1:18:07
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF AN IDEA. WE NEVER QUITE GOT IT TOGETHER. I LOVE THE RESPONSE THAT WE GOT
1:18:14
FROM THE AUDIENCE WHO KNOW THIS. WE'VE NEVER PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. I THINK THE DIFFERENCES WE FINALLY HAVE THE DISPLAYS TO DO
1:18:19
IT. HAVE SOMETHING TO OF OFFER THATV CAN'T NECESSARILY RIVAL.
1:18:25
>> EXACTLY. YOU MOSTLY LOOK AT FLAT DISPLAYS. PHONES, LAPTOPS, WALL PANELS, ALL THAT SORT OF THING.
1:18:31
THIS IS GOING TO BE A NEW AGE, BECAUSE WE EXPERIENCE THE WORLD IN 3D, OUR BRAINS ARE WIRED FOR
1:18:38
IT, OUR VISUAL BIOLOGY IS WIRED FOR IT, AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
1:18:44
PROVE THAT THERE IS MORE EMOTIONAL ENGAGEMENT, MORE SENSE OF PRESENCE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH A
1:18:52
BLUMHOUSE HORROR FILM, YOUR FIGHT OR FLIGHT REFLEX IS MORE ENGAGED.
1:18:57
HOPEFULLY IF YOU'RE WATCHING A LOVE STORY YOU WILL CRY AN EXTRA TEAR OR SO. I DON'T KNOW HOW MEASURABLE IT IS IN HARD METRICS, BECAUSE IT
1:19:04
IS A BIT SUBJECTIVE, BUT I WANT TO SAY MAYBE 20% MORE
1:19:09
ENGAGEMENT. MY VISION IS A STEREO UBIQUITY FUTURE WHERE ALL OF OUR FEEDS,
1:19:17
OUR NEWS, OUR ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT, OUR LIVE STUFF -- >> SPORTS.
1:19:22
>> SPORTS, OF COURSE. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WRITING SOME AMAZING UIs FOR SPORTS.
1:19:27
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT. [LAUGHTER] THE POINT IS --
1:19:32
>> CAN'T TAKE THIS GUY ANYWHERE. [LAUGHTER] >> NOBODY IN THIS ROOM CAN SAY A
1:19:39
WORD, OKAY? I TRUST YOU GUYS.
1:19:44
BUT IT IS ALL IMMINENT. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS PIE-IN-THE-SKY DOWN THE LINE.
1:19:51
I THINK OUR TASK -- THE REASON WE HAVE PARTNERED, AND IT IS
1:19:56
UNDER -- IF I CAN SAY THAT, IT'S UNDER BOB MORGAN AND SARAH, OUR
1:20:02
GIG RIGHT NOW -- >> THERE THEY ARE. >> OUR GIG RIGHT NOW IS TO GET
1:20:09
OTHER FILMMAKERS AND SHOW RUNNERS. BY THE WAY, I THINK EPISODIC TELEVISION, SHORT FORM AND LONG
1:20:15
FORM, I THINK THAT'S THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT THAT PEOPLE HAVE HISTORICALLY IGNORED, BECAUSE SO MUCH 3D CONTENT WHICH
1:20:20
IS MADE FOR MOVIES. I CAN'T MAKE MOVIES FAST ENOUGH
1:20:25
TO FEED THIS PIPELINE. WHAT WE DO AT LIGHT STORE VISION, MY 3D COMPANY, WE BUILD
1:20:32
CAMERAS AND SYSTEMS AND NETWORKING TOOLS TO GIVE TO OTHER FILM -- NOT GIVE, TO
1:20:38
SUPPLY TO OTHER FILMMAKERS. >> TO GENEROUSLY HELP. FOR ONLY A SMALL FEE. >> FOR A SMALL FEE.
1:20:45
[LAUGHTER] OTHER FILMMAKERS AND SHOW RUNNERS AND BROADCASTERS AND SO ON, TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THIS
1:20:51
AVALANCHE OF CONTENT THAT THERE WILL BE AN ENORMOUS DEMAND FOR. >> THIS IS THE THING THAT I THINK IS UNDERAPPRECIATED.
1:20:57
YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN, OVER TIME, THE COST IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO BUILD THESE KINDS OF PRODUCTION SO THEY CAN BE DONE MUCH MORE
1:21:04
CONVENTIONALLY. YOU ARE DOING -- WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE FIRST "AVATAR --"
1:21:09
>> IT'S A BAD EXAMPLE. >> EVERYTHING IS HARD AND EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE. TRYING TO BRING IT INTO CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTIONS, THAT
1:21:15
PEOPLE DOING ANY KIND OF PRODUCTION ARE ABLE TO BRING THIS RICH OF AN EXPERIENCE TO THEIR AUDIENCE WHO WANTS TO
1:21:20
INVEST IN IT. >> SURE. IT'S NOT JUST BRINGING DOWN THE HARDWARE BUT IT'S MAKING THE HARDWARE SMARTER, A LOT OF
1:21:26
SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS AND DOWNSTREAM DIGITAL SOLUTIONS AND SO ON. WE WANT TO MAKE THIS STUFF SO IDIOT PROOF THAT WE CAN PUT A
1:21:32
PRODUCTION CAMERA OR PRODUCTION SYSTEM IN THE HANDS OF ANYBODY, ANYWHERE, AND IT'LL TAKE CARE OF
1:21:38
THE DECISION-MAKING AROUND WHAT MAKES GOOD STEREO. WHAT MAKES IT EASY ON OUR EYES, EASY ON OUR BRAINS, WHERE WE ARE
1:21:45
NOT GETTING EYESTRAIN ARE ALL THOSE THINGS. IT'S TAKEN US 25 YEARS TO FIGURE OUT THE KIND OF ALGORITHM FOR THAT.
1:21:50
WE WANT TO MAKE IT AND BUILD IT INTO THIS GEAR AND MAKE IT
1:21:57
AVAILABLE, AND THEN THAT WILL ENABLE -- I CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF FAST ENOUGH, BUT THERE'S THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PRODUCING
1:22:02
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOURS A YEAR OF CONTENT, AND IT WILL
1:22:07
FLOW ACROSS YOUR DEVICES. >> YOU CAN THINK ABOUT GOING FROM AUTOFOCUS, THE
1:22:13
ABILITY -- YOUR OCULAR DISTANCE CAN BE AUTOMATIC. >> AUTO STEREO, BASICALLY. >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS
1:22:19
MADE THIS PARTNERSHIP SO GREAT, AND YOU GET A SENSE OF IT FROM THE TWO OF US, THE PARTNERSHIP,
1:22:25
YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO HAS HAD A CREATIVE VISION. HE START WITH A CREATIVE VISION, A PRODUCT, AN IDEA OF THE STORY
1:22:30
YOU WANT TO TELL AND HOW YOU WANT PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE THAT STORY, AND HE WORKED BACKWARDS AND TACKLE ALL THOSE PIECES.
1:22:36
WHEN DID YOU FIRST COME UP WITH THE "AVATAR" IDEA? >> I WAS 19 WHEN I HAD A DREAM
1:22:42
ABOUT A BIOLUMINESCENT FOREST. I WROTE THE TREATMENT IN 1995. SO I HAVE BEEN MAKING "AVATAR"
1:22:47
IN SOME FORM IN MY MIND AND THEN IN PRACTICE FOR OVER 30 YEARS.
1:22:53
[APPLAUSE] >> SO IN 1995 THE THING THAT YOU NEED DOESN'T EXIST YET.
1:23:00
>> NONE OF IT EXISTED. >> AND THEN YOU SEE THE PARALLELS BETWEEN
1:23:05
MARK ZUCKERBERG AND JAMES CAMERON. PEOPLE WHO SEE THE FUTURE. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK IN REALITY LABS FOR TEN YEARS NOW,
1:23:14
AND WE ARE OBSESSIVE ABOUT A VISION OF THE FUTURE, WHICH YOU HAVE A DERIVED OUT YET, BUT WE SEE THE PROGRESS.
1:23:19
I WILL SAY IT FINALLY FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING DOWNHILL NOW, STARTING TO FEEL LIKE IT'S PICKING UP MOMENTUM NOT ONLY IN
1:23:25
THE HARDWARE BUT IN THE CONTENT SIDE. >> YOU ARE WILLING THE FUTURE INTO EXISTENCE. YOU SAW CLEARLY, AND THIS MOMENT
1:23:33
IN HISTORY FEELS A LOT TO ME LIKE IT DID BACK IN THE EARLY '90s, LATE '80s AND EARLY
1:23:39
'90s WHEN CG WAS FIRST MANIFESTING ITSELF. "YOU'RE GOING TO REPLACE ACTORS,
1:23:45
IT'LL NEVER LOOK REAL, ANALOG'S ANSWER." AND THAT'S WHY I FOUNDED A
1:23:51
COMPANY CALLED DIGITAL DOMAIN. IT WAS REVOLUTIONARY IN ITS
1:23:57
MOMENT, IT IS HO-HUM AND UBIQUITOUS TODAY. SO I HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN HISTORICALLY IN MY OWN LIFE
1:24:02
EXPERIENCE HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE MASSIVE CHANGE. AND THEN THAT LED TO 3D.
1:24:09
EVERYBODY ACCEPTS THE FACT THAT WE GO TO DIGITAL MOVIE THEATERS NOW. OBVIOUS, RIGHT?
1:24:15
EXCEPT THAT WHEN THE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY EXISTED, IT WASN'T ADOPTED RIGHT AWAY. IT TOOK 3D TO GET THE THEATERS
1:24:22
TO CONVERT TO DIGITAL. >> IT TOOK YOU. >> WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF
1:24:27
THAT. YEAH. AND I WAS ACTUALLY TALKING TO THE TEAM AT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS
1:24:33
THAT DEVELOPED THE CHIP THAT MADE THAT PROJECTION POSSIBLE AND SAY, EMBED IT IN YOUR
1:24:39
SERVERS AND ELECTRONICS, THE ABILITY TO CARRY TWO STREAMS. BECAUSE THEY DID THAT, DIGITAL
1:24:48
PROJECTION ROLLED OUT AND NOW IT IS EVERYWHERE OTHER THAN THE OCCASIONAL ARKHOUSE SOMEPLACE WITH A 35-MILLIMETER PRINT.
1:24:53
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE LIVED THROUGH ENOUGH OF THESE REVOLUTIONS, YOU START TO SEE THEM COMING AS A
1:24:59
WAVE, LIKE A GOOD SURFER. I KNOW YOU SERVE, I WATCH IT FROM BEACH.
1:25:06
>> FROM UNDERWATER. >> I WATCH IT FROM UNDERWATER. >> WE HAVE ONE MORE EXCITING PIECE COMING. I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR
1:25:12
COMING TO CONNECT. IT IS OUR HONOR TO HAVE YOU. I CAN'T WAIT TO CHECK OUT
1:25:18
"AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH," AS I'M SURE EVERYBODY AGREES, WHEN IT HITS THE THEATERS DECEMBER 19TH.
1:25:25
[APPLAUSE]
1:25:30
AND, AS A SPECIAL SURPRISE, WE HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE NEVER BEFORE SEEN STUNNING 3D CLIP FROM
1:25:38
"AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH" FOR EVERYONE TO CHECK OUT INTIMA STATIONS HERE FOR ATTENDEES AND AVAILABLE ON ALL META QUEST
1:25:46
DEVICES IN HORIZON TV FOR A LIMITED VIEWING WINDOW. THANK YOU ALL, AND THANK YOU, JAMES, AND TRUST THE PROCESS.
1:25:52
THIS IS ALL GOING TO BE VERY EXCITING. [APPLAUSE]
1:25:59
NOW I'M GOING TO CUE MARK TO TAKE US TO THE FINISH LINE.
1:26:05
>> THANK YOU, JAMES AND BUZZ.
1:26:17
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE "AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH" THIS DECEMBER, AND FOR SOME AWESOME "AVATAR" CONTENT, HIT HORIZON TV. AND I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE NEW FALL 2025 LINE OF GLASSES AND
1:26:22

1:26:30
[APPLAUSE] ONE LAST LIVE DEMO.
1:26:36
I DON'T LEARN! I DON'T LEARN. WE HAVE GOT AN AFTER PARTY OVER
1:26:42
AT META'S CLASSIC CAMPUS. DIPLO IS GOING TO PLAY.
1:26:48
PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING DIPLO. [APPLAUSE]
1:26:53
>> HOW YOU DOING? >> GOOD. ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU ARE A LEGENDARY D.J., THE PEOPLE
1:26:59
ARE ALSO STARTING TO LEARN THAT YOU ARE A BIG RUNNER AND YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE DIPLO RUN CLUB.
1:27:05
